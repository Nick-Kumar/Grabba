# Grabba (Script)


### Background ###


Reservations, at the hotel where I was employed, had to be inputted manually into the local system. All reservations came in the form of emails.
To somewhat alleviate the issue of repeat or simple reservations, I created this VSTO plugin.


### Working ###


All emails had a defined format, from their respective travel-agent. Major details of the guest would be captured using regex and inputted into the database's
respective fields. Hence, the name Grabba.


### Outcome ###


Unfortunately, the company moved on to a new version of the reservation system, which included this feature. Therefore, I am uploading this on github.
